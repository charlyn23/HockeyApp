# HockeyApp

This assignment will require you to start an Android project (Android Studio

is recommended) and demonstrate coding ability through a variety of

practical applications. (Please feel free to use third-party libraries where

appropriate, and store the data however you wish.)

Please build a rudimentary contact list app using the latest stable API level

that does the following:

1. Set up an Activity or Fragment to display a roster of hockey players.

2. Download and parse the JSON at data at https://jc-
xerxes.gpshopper.com/android_eval.json

3. Display the roster in a scrollable list.

a. The adapter should display views that show the person's picture (on

the left), name (as the title), and position (as the subtitle).

b. Load the images asynchronously so UI is not blocked while waiting

for downloads.

c. When a row is clicked, use a new view to display the contact details

(picture, name, and position, laid out however you like) and

transition to said view.

4. The rest of the design (or lack of it) is up to you! Make it as ugly or pretty

as you want.
